# practicingdev/ama

A repository to ask [@practicingdev](https://twitter.com/practicingdev) anything.

I'm the author of [Programming Beyond Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Beyond-Practices-More-Monkey/dp/1491943823/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1496846875&sr=8-1&keywords=programming+beyond+practices), a book which focuses on the non-code aspects of software development at the intersection of technology, business, and human interests.

I also built [Practicing Ruby](http://practicingruby.com), and was the original author for [PrawnPDF](http://prawnpdf.org) (which I'm no longer working on, but was lead maintainer for years and years)

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/practicingdev/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/practicingdev/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@practicingdev](https://twitter.com/practicingdev) on
Twitter.

### Forking

This repository was forked from [holman/ama](https://github.com/holman/ama). If you'd like to create your own, fork that repo instead of this one!
